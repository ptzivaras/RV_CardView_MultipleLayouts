# RecycleView_with_CardView_MultipleLayouts

1)Add to build.grandle(Module) -> dependencies
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview-selection:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0'
    
2)This is a sample of a List with 2 Layouts. I have a for loop and if i<5 use Layout1 else use Layout2.. So potentially you can have 2 buttons or spinner and add to the 
List the data you want and which Layout to Choose or you can have in a List rows of dynamic different layout.
